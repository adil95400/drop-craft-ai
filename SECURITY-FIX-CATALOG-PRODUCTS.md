# Security Fix: Catalog Products Data Protection

## Issue Fixed
**Critical Security Vulnerability**: Product catalog was publicly readable, exposing sensitive business intelligence to potential competitors.

## Problem
The `catalog_products` table had an overly permissive RLS policy that allowed all authenticated users to access:
- Supplier names and contact information
- Cost prices and profit margins
- Sales data and competition scores
- Business intelligence data

This could allow competitors to:
- Scrape pricing and margin data
- Identify and target suppliers
- Undercut competitive positioning

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced RLS Policies
- **Removed** the broad "authenticated users view public catalog" policy
- **Added** admin-only access for full business intelligence data
- **Blocked** direct table access to force use of secure functions

### 2. Secure Data Access Function
Created `get_catalog_products_secure()` function that:
- **Masks sensitive data** for regular users (profit margins, supplier details, etc.)
- **Provides full access** to admins only
- **Logs all access** for security monitoring
- **Requires authentication** to prevent anonymous access

### 3. Updated Application Code
- Modified `CatalogService` to use the new secure function
- Maintained existing functionality while protecting sensitive data
- Preserved performance with proper caching

## Data Visibility by Role

### Regular Users (Non-Admin)
Can see:
- Product names, descriptions, images
- Public pricing information
- Ratings and reviews
- Availability status
- Basic categorization

### Admin Users
Can see everything including:
- Supplier information and contacts
- Cost prices and profit margins
- Sales data and competition scores
- Business intelligence metrics

## Security Benefits
- **Competitive protection**: Sensitive pricing and supplier data is now protected
- **Access control**: Role-based data masking prevents data leakage
- **Audit trail**: All access is logged for security monitoring
- **Zero downtime**: Fix was implemented without breaking existing functionality

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED** - Security vulnerability has been patched and tested. The application now properly protects sensitive business data while maintaining full functionality for legitimate users.
